# HTTP Proxy Server
This is a simple server that will proxy a URL.

## Starting the Server
Run `python3 http_proxy_server.py`. This will run the server on localhost:8000.

## Using the Server
Using the server is very simple. Say you want to proxy https://google.com. All you have to do is specify that as the path to this server's URL. For example, the full url for Google would be http://localhost:8000/https://google.com.
